# ashokaDemo

This is a set of scraping and visualization tools to work with data from Ashoka's AMS.

To set up:

 - Download the major minor reports and use scrape_students.ipynb to generate the dataset.
 - Use analyse_students to generate the visualizations from the major minor report.
 - Use analyse_finances to generate the visualizations based on FCRA disclosures.
